# Software-Engineering-Assignments
**This repository contains the projects and assignments being done as a part of the course:  CS3400 - Principles of Software Engineering.**

**What is the Application about?**

Lets take an example. We have a TV at home. Suddenly something happens to it and it doesn't work anymore. 
Or your favourite chair broke down and needs urgent carpentry. Or somethings wrong with your computer. Now 
there are three things you can do. First, is Google how to fix it. Second is to look for a repair guy on the
net and let him do his work which takes its own jolly time. Or, you can use this app.

HelpYou is bringing help at door delivery. Every time you need a guy to fix something, you put it up on the 
app according to the domain of help needed. The people skilled enough and registered on the app for that 
domain are instantly pinged. The first person who gets back to you gets the job. He shows up at your door, 
finishes your work and that's it. We can get help with anything at our doorstep with HelpYou :)

### App status:

## Tasks accomplished

## 1) Created a web server: [myWebsite](http://host-iittp.000webhostapp.com/)

![mywebsite](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24961068/29240539-20c5daba-7f85-11e7-8d8f-7d094141d3ff.png)

## 2) Created a database and wrote PHP scripts to send and retrieve data from this database hosted by the server.

## 5) Very basic prototype of App made and tested with just two activities but involves intense server handling.

## Tasks left:

# 1) UI for replying to the user who posted the problem and exchange of phone numbers between the service provider and problem postor.

# 2) Improve the UI for easy access.

**Discussions:** (Fill in any comments and suggestions here)

Tasks for Vikas: Learn about creating a grid view to display data from server( Right now you can focus on
creating a grid view without bringing server into picture).
Plan the looks and contents of each page. Frame down the background details. Ex. How the start page looks like?
Who can login? What's the next page? Do we need to create a tab-view or a list-view to display data? 
  
Tasks for Akash: Get the server running, write PHP code to extract and insert data into server. 

Comments: I haven't created an Android studio project yet, will do in sometime. Then you can clone the project and 
import into your Android Studio. Meanwhile try cloning this repo and push another test file which I can pull and you try 
pulling the files I have pushed into your local machine! You need to pull before you can push!

10/8/2017 7 AM: Got a link of a tutorial for the required view: https://blog.mindorks.com/android-expandable-news-feed-example-4b4544e1fe7e . I can start experimenting if you upload your project file.
