# Software-Engineering-Assignments
**This repository contains the projects and assignments being done as a part of the course:  CS3400 - Principles of Software Engineering.**

**What is the Application about?**

Lets take an example. We have a TV at home. Suddenly something happens to it and it doesn't work anymore. 
Or your favourite chair broke down and needs urgent carpentry. Or somethings wrong with your computer. Now 
there are three things you can do. First, is Google how to fix it. Second is to look for a repair guy on the
net and let him do his work which takes its own jolly time. Or, you can use this app.

HelpYou is bringing help at door delivery. Every time you need a guy to fix something, you put it up on the 
app according to the domain of help needed. The people skilled enough and registered on the app for that 
domain are instantly pinged. The first person who gets back to you gets the job. He shows up at your door, 
finishes your work and that's it. We can get help with anything at our doorstep with HelpYou :)
