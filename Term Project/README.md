**Project Goal:**

Mapping design patterns in OOP for developing softwares to Functional paradigm and demonstration using Scala.

---

**Project resources and Plan**

Being a completely unventured area, no research papers were found. The resources I have are as follows:

---

**1) Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason**

**2) Additionally the only lecture in same direction I found was:** [Functional programming design patterns by Scott Wlaschin](https://vimeo.com/113588389)

**3) Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software Book by by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, Grady Booch (The Gang of Four)**

**4) Functional Programming Patterns in Scala and Clojure by Micheal Linn.**

**5) Research paper:** [https://www.scala-lang.org/old/sites/default/files/FrederikThesis.pdf]

**Updates on Work 9/10/17**

1) Reading Gang of Four Book to understand patterns in Object Oriented World.

2) No writing for paper has been done yet. I started with work rather than literature for paper. Will do the work as soon as quiz ends.

3) Finished Mapping **Pattern 1: Functional Interfaces**. The code with comments for demonstration can be found here[https://github.com/akash-07/Software-Engineering-Assignments/tree/master/Term%20Project/Patterns/src/main/scala].

No write up for functional interfaces has been done. The comments do explain a few things.

4) ** Pattern 2: Handling exceptions** is being worked upon. The writeup can be found here[https://github.com/akash-07/Software-Engineering-Assignments/blob/master/Term%20Project/handlingExceptions/readMe.md]. 

No code has been written yet for pattern demonstration.
